<h1>The best movies according to Jo√£o</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of All-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>I fell in love with this movie the first time i land eyes on it, it's beautiful and was the beggining of a love story with Ghibli studios</p>

<h3>Midsommar</h3>
<p>I'ts a movie that entered on my list not long ago but already made into the top 3, it's scary without jump scares (wich i hate) and the photography is excellent </p>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>A 2014 movie that i watched recently, and right after the movie ended i asked myself why did it took so long for me to watch it, it got everything i love and mark all the boxes.</p>
